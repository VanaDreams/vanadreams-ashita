# Retail character capture — design

Date: 2026-09-13. Status: approved for build (client half); the site and server halves are specified here for the sessions that own them.

## Purpose

A player on retail runs one command and gets a snapshot of their character: jobs, skills, spells, abilities, key items, every bag, gear, gil, look, nation, rank, titles. The launcher sends the snapshot to fairywitch.ca. The server side imports it onto a Vanadreams account so the player arrives as the character they were, with the story starting fresh.

## Rulings

Everything the client exposes is captured. Delivery is the launcher uploading through the site. Capture runs on command only. Quests and missions are not ported.

## The three halves

| Half | Where | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capture addon `charcapture` | `addons/charcapture/` in this repo | built |
| Launcher Capture page and upload | `launcher/` in this repo | built |
| Site endpoint and queue, Claudette importer | fairywitch.ca worker; `vanadreams/` host scripts | the site and server sessions |

## The snapshot file

`config\charcapture\<CharacterName>.json` in the Ashita folder, UTF-8, one object:

}
```

Job ids are the game's (1 WAR … 22 RUN). Skill ids are Ashita's indexes for `GetCombatSkill` and `GetCraftSkill`. Container ids are the game's, and LandSandBoat's are the same (0 inventory, 1 mog safe, 2 storage, 3 temporary, 4 locker, 5 satchel, 6 sack, 7 case, 8 wardrobe, 9 mog safe 2, 10–16 wardrobes 2–8). `extra` is the item's 24-byte extra block, hex, which carries augments, trial numbers and linkshell colours. Gil is the count of the pseudo-item in inventory slot 0.

Every array is complete, not a diff: a snapshot replaces the previous one.

Added in addon 0.1.1 (14 Sept 2026), still schema 1, both optional: `merit_upgrades`, an object of merit id to upgrade count (the server's `char_merit.meritid` and `upgrades`), and `job_point_upgrades`, an object of job id to an object of upgrade index (0–9) to level (the server's `char_job_points.jptype0`–`jptype9`). Ashita's memory has neither, so the addon reads them from the packets the game sends when the Merit Points menu (0x08C) and the Job Points menu (0x08D) are opened, and the player opens both once before `/capture`. When a menu was not opened the field is absent and `not_captured` says which one.

Added in addon 0.1.2 (14 Sept 2026, Lee's ruling: bring it all): `quest_mission_packets`, an object of the 0x056 packet port (four hex digits) to the packet's 32-byte data block in hex, kept raw. The game sends these on zoning: ports 0x0050–0x0088, 0x00E0, 0x00F0, 0x0100 are current quests per log area, 0x0090–0x00C8, 0x00E8, 0x00F8, 0x0108 completed quests per area, 0x00D0 completed nation and Zilart missions, 0x00D8 completed ToAU and WotG missions, 0x0030/0x0038 completed Campaign, and 0xFFFF the current missions (nation, Zilart, CoP with status, addons, SoA, RoV). The area order and bit layout are the server's own (`enums/quest_log.h`, `enums/mission_log.h`, `packets/s2c/0x056_*`), so the importer rebuilds `chars.quests`, `chars.missions`, `chars.assault` and `chars.campaign` from them directly. Fame is never sent to the client; by the same ruling the importer grants rank 9 (613 points) in every fame area.

Known gaps in schema 1, found on the first real capture (14 Sept 2026): `weaponskills` and `traits` come back as a handful of small numbers rather than the real lists and must be ignored by the importer, which loses nothing because the server grants weapon skills from skill level and traits from job level on its own; `character.size` can be -1 when the model size is not readable, so the importer treats anything outside 0–2 as 0; the main-hand and sub-hand equipment slots (0 and 1) can be absent, so the player re-equips weapons once in game. Every other field checked out against the character it was taken from.

## The addon

`/capture` writes the file and prints a one-line summary: name, main job and level, item count across all bags, gil. `/capture show` prints the last summary again. It reads only through Ashita's memory managers, sends no packets and changes nothing. It runs on retail and on any server; the file says which.

Data comes from: `IPlayer` for jobs, levels, master levels, job points, merits, limit points, exp, skills, spells, abilities, weapon skills, traits, key items, nation, rank, rank points, title, homepoint, residence; `IInventory` for every container and the equipped slots; `IEntity` for name, race, look and size; `IParty` member 0 for the server id.

## The launcher

A Capture page in the menu lists the snapshots in `config\charcapture\`, shows each summary, and has "Send to Vanadreams". Sending posts the JSON to the capture route with the player's Vanadreams username, taken from the selected profile's remembered login, and shows the reply: queued with a reference, or the reason it was refused. Nothing is sent without the button.

## The site endpoint, as built (14 Sept 2026)

`POST https://fairywitch.ca/api/public/vanadreams/capture` with the snapshot as the body and the player's Vanadreams login in `X-Vanadreams-User`. The worker checks the login shape, the 2 MB limit, `schema: 1` and a character name, allows five sends an hour per login, and commits the file into the private server repo `VanaDreams/vanadreams` (it was `Finalferrin/vanadreams` until the 20 Sept 2026 transfer) on branch `vanadreams` at `captures/<login>/<Name>.json` through the GitHub contents API with the worker's own key (`CAPTURE_GITHUB_TOKEN`, a fine-grained token whose resource owner is VanaDreams, with Contents read and write on that one repo). A second send for the same character replaces the file. Replies `{ ok: true, reference: <commit>, queued: 1, path }`, or `{ ok: false, error }` with 400, 413, 429, 502 or 503 (drop-box not set up). Claudette pulls the repo and `tools/vanadreams/import_capture.py` there does the import by hand. The D1 queue and bridge endpoints below were the earlier plan and are not built.

## The site endpoint, earlier plan (superseded)

`POST /api/public/vanadreams/capture`, body the snapshot JSON, header `X-Vanadreams-User: <username>`. Limits: 2 MB, schema 1, character name present. Stores a row in a D1 table:

```
vanadreams_captures(id INTEGER PK, username TEXT, charname TEXT, received_at TEXT, bytes INTEGER, snapshot TEXT, status TEXT DEFAULT 'queued', note TEXT)
```

Replies `{ "ok": true, "reference": "<id>", "queued": <count for that user> }`. A second snapshot for the same username and charname replaces the queued one. Rate: five per hour per username. The bridge gets `GET /api/bridge/vanadreams/captures/next` returning the oldest queued row and marking it `taken`, and `POST /api/bridge/vanadreams/captures/<id>` with `{status, note}` to close it, both under the existing bridge token.

## The importer, for the server session

A script on Claudette pulls the queue through the bridge and maps a snapshot onto a Vanadreams character, run by hand per port after a look at the row. Mapping:

| Snapshot | Table |
| --- | --- |
| character.name, nation | `chars` (charname, nation); `chars.keyitems` from key_items; `chars.abilities`, `chars.weaponskills`, `chars.titles` bitmasks from the arrays |
| jobs.levels, master flags | `char_jobs` (one column per job); `char_stats` (mjob, sjob, mlvl, slvl); `char_exp` (merits, limits) |
| jobs.job_points | `char_job_points` |
| skills | `char_skills` (skillid, value, rank) |
| spells | `char_spells` |
| inventory, gil | `char_inventory` (location, slot, itemId, quantity, extra); gil as item 65535 in location 0 slot 0 |
| equipment | `char_equip` |
| look, character.race/face/size | `char_look` |
| character.rank, rank_points | `char_profile` |

Not imported, by ruling: quests, missions, fame, event flags. The importer refuses a snapshot whose username has no Vanadreams account, or whose character name already exists on a different account, and writes the reason back through the bridge so the launcher can show it.

## Tests

The addon has no automated tests; it is exercised by running `/capture` on a character and reading the file. The launcher's upload client is tested against a local stub for the reply shapes. The importer is the server session's to test against a copy of the database.
