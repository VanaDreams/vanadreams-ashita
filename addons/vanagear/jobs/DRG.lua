    Which kinds of sets this job gets, and any weight that differs from vg\roles.lua. A weight
    here replaces the one in roles.lua for that stat; 0 turns the stat off for this job. Bands
    are level ranges (M401): the band the player's level falls in is laid over Tweaks.

    - FFXIclopedia, Dragoon Guide by Sharaa (2009-10, levels 1-75, with Dakk's haste build) and
      Dragoon: Guide to Weapons and Armor (Juso, 2010). Two builds: meat, "stack lots of acc
      and eat meat", and sushi, "lots of STR and ATT". "High Delay, it hurts when you miss."
      31-60 Peacock Charm "THE best Accuracy piece on your neck", Sniper's Rings "not
      optional", Swift and Headlong Belts for haste, Scorpion Harness, Ecphoria Ring and
      Chivalrous Chain for Store TP, Pole Grip's double attack; "Penta Thrust is very accuracy
      dependent, so stack on the acc". 61-75 Assault Jerkin's attack, Optical Hat, Askar
      Korazin "some DA, store TP that will push most DRGs into a 6-hit build", Homam triple
      attack and accuracy; "do not try to be a full haste build if you are not planning on
      going 8/8 polearm skill".
    - BG-wiki, Community Dragoon Guide and Dragoon Guide by Kaius (level 99): "the next two
      most important aspects to any engaged set are accuracy and haste", to the 80% delay cap
      with Hasso and the wyvern's ability haste; "Store TP and multi-hit come after haste";
      "a nice balance between X-hit and STP"; jumps "maximize TP return"; weaponskills
      Stardiver multi-attack, TP bonus, STR, attack; Impulse Drive and Camlann's Torment
      weaponskill damage first; Drakesbane crit; Geirskogul DEX.
