    vanagear: Ninja - the blink tank (Lee, 22 Oct 2026).

    Which kinds of sets this job gets, and any weight that differs from vg\roles.lua. A weight
    here replaces the one in roles.lua for that stat; 0 turns the stat off for this job. Bands
    are level ranges (M401): the band the player's level falls in is laid over Tweaks. The
    fighting set (Tp_Default, "Engaged") is the tanking set from 31 to 75; the damage swaps
    are the weaponskill sets, as the guides have them.

    Read 22 Oct 2026 against:
    - FFXIclopedia, Ninja - Doing it right (2013, levels 1-99, "NIN found its role as a tank.
      And this is how I've treated it"): 1-30 "accuracy will be a pretty big issue", a STR+2
      and a DEX+2 ring, other slots "for defense, evasion or HP", evasion gear from 20; Ninjutsu
      skill capped so casts are not interrupted. 31-60 Utsusemi: Ni at 37 "completely changes
      the feel of NIN"; haste "lowers recast timers on magic spells, which is defensively why
      it's so important", haste gear on as the cast finishes; enmity gear from the 40s; Ninja
      Hatsuburi swapped in to land the enfeebles. 61-75 Arhat's Gi +1 and Jinpachi +1 "for the
      physical damage reduction stat", hands and legs for enmity, "attack speed is your best
      friend... wherever you can get haste gear, slap that on" (20% gear haste is a 28 s
      Utsusemi with the spell); the weaponskill swap is STR and attack, DEX and accuracy so all
      three hits of Blade: Jin land. 76-99 the enmity cap matters when tanking; fast cast on
      before the cast, haste on as it finishes; NIN/DRK "prioritized by Haste, Fast Cast, then
      enmity"; DD: "Haste, Double Attack, and then Dual Wield", more dual wield past the delay
      floor lowers TP gain. Also Dibble's Essential Ninja Equipment Guide (2012), the Ninja
      Equipment Guide chart and the How-To Guide, all read in full.
    - BG-wiki, The Silent Silhouette and Finans Gearset Guides/Ninja (2026, level 99): NIN is
      "a mid-tier damage dealer with defensive and utility strengths", not the main tank in
      every fight; Utsusemi midcast "FC +40, -50% DT" and "FC +56"; "high DT in all my sets";
      an idle evasion set; Hachiya pieces for ninjutsu magic accuracy; Store TP at the haste
      cap; weaponskills: Shun DEX and double attack, Ten and Chi STR and weaponskill damage,
      Hi AGI and weaponskill damage, Jin crit.
