    vanagear: Geomancer - a support job (Lee, 22 Oct 2026).

    Which kinds of sets this job gets, and any weight that differs from vg\roles.lua. A weight
    here replaces the one in roles.lua for that stat; 0 turns the stat off for this job. Bands
    are level ranges (M401): the band the player's level falls in is laid over Tweaks. No
    fighting set: "semi gimp DD", no melee gear section in any guide.

    Read 22 Oct 2026 against:
    - BG-wiki, Geomancer's Thought Bubble (2019, level 99; the Community Geomancer Guide is
      an empty stub): levelled "mostly solo with Trusts"; at 99 buff with Indi-, debuff with
      Geo-, "nuking and spot healing are secondary". Geomancy: "the first priority is
      reaching 900 combined Geomancy and Handbell skill. Potency stops increasing past that
      point", then Conserve MP and Indicolure duration; only the highest Geomancy+ piece
      counts. The Luopan: keeping it alive is "the top idle goal"; it has -50% damage taken
      natively, pet damage taken caps at -87.5%, "so the GEO needs 37.5% more", with pet regen
      about 22; the older Refresh and Regen idles are rejected for it. Fast cast is capped
      from gear. Nuking is Idris and magic attack; bursts stack burst damage and magic attack.
    - FFXIclopedia Geomancer (the job page, read in full for when things arrive: Indi-Refresh
      30, Indi-Fury 34, Conserve MP 25, the burst trait 79) and Geomancy Skill: "Geomancer's
      base JSE gearsets aren't equippable until level 99" and every skill booster is 99-era,
      so no band below 99 has a stated priority: the base weights apply there.
    - The Magic Burst pages: Static Earring at 72 is the first burst gear GEO can wear; the
      40% gear cap; Mujin Band at 88 outside it.
    - Earlier (M382): Bubble Trouble (FFXIAH 112). Bolster, Life Cycle, Full Circle, Theurgic
      Focus and the rest: their sets come from what the server reads on the press.
