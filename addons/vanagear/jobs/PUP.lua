    Which kinds of sets this job gets, and any weight that differs from vg\roles.lua. A weight
    here replaces the one in roles.lua for that stat; 0 turns the stat off for this job. Bands
    are level ranges (M401): the band the player's level falls in is laid over Tweaks.

    - FFXIclopedia, Puppetmaster Guide by Poof (2007), Puppetmasters Guide to Vanadiel
      (Wolfandre), The Definitive Solo Guide (Guwhenivar and others, 2010-11), Puppetmaster on
      a Budget (Zhecks), A guide for new Pups, Scoda's How To, all read in full. The automaton
      is the focus; solo "the master is the tank, you will want to gear up with as much
      Evasion + gear as possible"; "Evasion is key"; Battle Gloves at 14 "the most useful piece
      of hand gear", DEX or STR rings, Martial Arts at 25. 31-60 evasion pieces, Rajas Ring
      for Store TP, Swift Belt, Peacock Charm "main TP piece". 61-75 Pantin Taj "auto regen",
      Optical Hat, Chivalrous Chain and Potent Belt for the melee master, Boxer's Mantle.
    - BG-wiki, String Theory (Fabiano, 2022, level 99): master TP "Double/Triple/Quad Attack,
      Store TP, Accuracy/Attack, Martial Arts, and Haste"; the pet wants its haste cap (26%)
      and double attack, Store TP for ranged pets; pet weaponskills Bone Crusher double
      attack, Arcuballista, Daze and Chimera Ripper TP bonus, Asuran Fists accuracy and
      attack; the tank automaton wants damage taken and regen; Repair potency caps at +50%.
      Community Puppetmaster Guide: the same, with no idle section.
    - Earlier (M382): PUP Gearsets (FFXIAH 426) for the base pet weights below. Frames,
      heads, attachments and maneuvers are the job's centre and vanagear cannot choose them;
      the guides' setups per level range are kept in the M401 reading notes.
